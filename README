We are using a Python library that makes accessing Steam API calls easier, just like Tweepy does for twitter.
	This needs to be installed for our code to run: https://github.com/Lagg/steamodd

Our API key is removed (because of the nature of GitHub), so it will not run as-is.
We can provide the API key if needed.

Then just run recommender.py.  It will print out the top 10 games.  

A sample run can be seen in "output.txt"
