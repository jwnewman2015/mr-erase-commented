We are using a Python library that makes accessing Steam API calls easier, just like Tweepy does for Twitter.
	This needs to be installed for our code to run: https://github.com/Lagg/steamodd

Our API key is removed (because the repository is public), so it will not run as-is.
We can provide an API key if needed.

When you have a key, add it in line 206 of recommender.py and run it:
	python recommender.py

Right now it has a super small dataset, and will print out the top 10 games.  

A sample run can be seen in "output.txt"
